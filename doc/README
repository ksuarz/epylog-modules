epylog
------
epylog is a simple new log notifier and parser which runs periodically
(hourly or daily, whichever you prefer), tails your logs, tries to
process some of the entries in order to present them in a more
comprehensive format, and then mails you the output.

The epylog engine should work on most unix systems, alhough currently
the modules are only written to work with linux (and in particularly,
the dulug distribution of Linux). It should work with any Red Hat
distribution concurrent with Dulug release and maybe some others.
