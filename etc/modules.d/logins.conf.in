# This is a fun setting. You can list domains that are "safe" here.
# E.g. if your org's domain is example.com and you generally don't 
# expect logins from hosts in example.com domain to be suspicious, you
# can add "example.com$" as a safe domain. This way anyone logging in from
# a remote host not matching *.example.com will be flagged in red and the
# full hostname of the connecting machine will be printed in the report.
# List multiple values separated by comma.
# E.g.: safe_domains = example.com$, foo.edu$
# The default is .*, meaning all domains are considered safe. To turn
# this off specify something like:
# safe_domains = !.*
safe_domains = .*
