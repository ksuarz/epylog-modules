epylog v0.9.0
------------
- Preparing for the 1.0 version.
- Added epylog.pm and ported the modules so they use it. As a result, the
  memory footprint dropped DRAMATICALLY. We are talking from 400Mb RAM use
  on a 50Mb logfile to just over 25Mb.
- Added lockfile support in the core.
- weedeater.mod.sh now checks for weed.list.local.
- Wrote man files.

epylog v0.3.4
------------
- Fixing a race condition vulnerability.

epylog v0.3.3
------------
- Tiny change in logins.mod.pl so it doesn't chop off the trailing
  octet in connect scan recognition routines (looks like a change in
  OpenSSH-3.x).

epylog v0.3.0, v0.3.1, v0.3.2
-----------------------------
- Just hunting and squashing misc stupid bugs.

epylog v0.3.0b
---------------
- Full rewrite of imp.mod.
- Significant changes to firewall.mod by Michael Stenner.
- Miscellaneous fixes.

epylog v0.3.0-a1
----------------
- Added option to append unparsed entries at the top vs. at the bottom.
- Added option to send raw logs gzipped in an attachment (depends on
  metamail)
- Changed the way weeding is done so modules don't conflict with 
  each-other. There will be trade-offs for speed, but integrity in this
  case is more important.
- Full rewrite of logins.mod
- Full rewrite of reboots.mod
- Full rewrite of annoy.mod
- Changes in weedeater.mod
- Added template.mod.pl, a template for perl modules.

epylog v0.2.5
-------------
- Enhancements to modules: reboots, logins

epylog v0.2.4
-------------
- Bugfixes to modules: annoy, imp, ipchains
- Added module: iptables by Michael Stenner
- Minor changes to the epylog script

epylog v0.2.3
-------------
- Bugfixes and enhancements of modules.
- IMP module added by Seth Vidal

epylog v0.2.2
-------------
- A more comrehensive README in docs.

epylog v0.2.1
-------------
First release to have a changelog. Generally, in 0.2 the following things
occured:
- dropped the requirement for epylog-init.sh. Now epylog will see if offset
  files are present and if not, then it will initialize them automatically
  at the first run, and make a report based on the last 100 lines of each
  newly-initialized log (or all of them if lines < 100).
- incorporated log-rotation workarounds. If the file was log-rotated, then
  epylog will go out, find the rotated logfile, and append whichever lines
  were added to the logfile before it was rotated. This way no log entries
  go un-analyzed.
- tweaked some modules and fixed some -z bugs.
