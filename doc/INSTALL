INSTALL
--------
Currently there is no build system outside of RPM. It doesn't really
require one, as far as I am concerned. To install Epylog on a non-RPM
system (or if you don't want to use RPM), follow these steps:

Copy etc into /etc/epylog:
    cp -r etc /etc/epylog

Copy py/epylog into your python site-packages directory. E.g.:
    cp -r py/epylog /usr/lib/python/site-packages/
    (make sure this is site-packages for python-2.2. On some systems
     both python-1.5 and python-2-2 will be installed, in which case
     the location for site-packages would be:
     /usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages)

Copy modules into /usr/share/epylog:
    mkdir -p /usr/share/epylog
    cp -r modules /usr/share/epylog/

Copy perl/epylog.pm into /usr/lib/perl5/site-perl:
    cp perl/epylog.pm /usr/lib/perl5/site-perl/
    (NOTE: epylog.pm is only useful if you are planning on
     using/writing external perl modules for epylog. There are none
     shipping with epylog by default, so there is no need to install
     epylog.pm if you are not going to use it)

Copy manpages in place:
    cd man
    gzip *.*
    cp *.8.gz /usr/share/man/man8/
    cp *.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5/
    (the man directory may be elsewhere on your system, so pay
     attention to your setup)

Install the cron file:
    cp cron/epylog-cron.daily /etc/cron.daily/epylog.cron
    chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/epylog.cron
    (you may want to run it hourly if you have lots of logs, or weekly, 
    if you don't really care. Use /etc/cron.hourly and /etc/cron.weekly in 
    this case)

Install the executable:
    cp epylog /usr/sbin/
    chmod 755 /usr/sbin/epylog

Edit the files in /etc/epylog to reflect your environment. This should
be it.

If there are any problems, please file a bug report, or contact the
mailing list.
