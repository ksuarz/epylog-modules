Epylog
------
Epylog is a new log notifier and parser which runs periodically out of
cron, looks at your logs, processes the entries in order to present
them in a more comprehensive format, and then provides you with the
output. It is written specifically with large network clusters in mind
where a lot of machines (around 50 and upwards) log to the same
loghost using syslog or syslog-ng.

Alternatively, Epylog can be invoked from the command line and provide
a log report based on a certain provided time period. In this case it
relies on syslog timestamps to find the offsets, as opposed to the
end-of-log offsets stored during the last run, though this behavior is
not as reliable and is easily thwarted by skewed clocks.
