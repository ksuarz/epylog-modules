# If you look into weed_dist.cf, you will notice that the entries
# are listed by section titles. List here only the sections that are
# relevant to your setup to speed things up. The more sections you
# enable, the slower matching will go, as it has to try more
# regexes. Note that [ADD] and [REMOVE] sections in weed_local are
# special, any other sections in that file will be ignored.
#
# You can use 'ALL' to enable all sections.
