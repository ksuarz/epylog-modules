This is where you should put your own notice rules. The format is
simple:
  <notice id="uniqueid" [critical="yes"]>
    <regex>python compliant regex string</regex>
    <regex>another regex, if more than one string is needed</regex>
    <report>What should go into the report</report>
  </notice>

See notice_dist.xml for examples. Any custom notices you add here do
not need to be added into the notices.conf file, as they will be
enabled automatically.

<notices>
</notices>
